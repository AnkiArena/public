# AnkiArena Frontend
I don't have frontend experience (my background is backend).  Presumable this will be a SPA React app? 


Would be nice to have two UIs - 
* Basic - default ui for new users. Review cards, create/update/delete cards (basic, reverse, cloze), create decks.
* Advanced - Full Anki UI.
